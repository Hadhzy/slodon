### Submitting Work:
1.  [Fork this project repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    and clone it to your local machine. (Read more
    [About Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks))
1.  Before working on any changes, try to
    [sync the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
    to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.
1.  On a
    [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
    in your fork (aka a "feature branch" and not `main`) work on a small focused
    change that only touches on a few files.
1.  Run `pre-commit` and make sure all files have formatting fixed. This
    simplifies life for reviewers.
1.  Package up a small bit of work that solves part of the problem
    [into a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
    and
    [send it out for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

1.  If you're lucky, we can merge your change into `main` without any problems.
    If there are changes to files you're working on, resolve them by:
First try to rebase as suggested
       - [in these instructions](https://timwise.co.uk/2019/10/14/merge-vs-rebase/#should-you-rebase).
      - If rebasing feels too painful, merge as suggested
        [in these instructions](https://timwise.co.uk/2019/10/14/merge-vs-rebase/#should-you-merge).
1.  Once you've resolved conflicts (if any), finish the review and
    [squash and merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits)
    your PR (when squashing try to clean up or update the individual commit
    messages to be one sensible single one).
1.  Merge in your change and move on to a new issue or the second step of your
    current issue.

Additionally, if someone is working on an issue that interests you, ask if they
need help on it or would like suggestions on how to approach the issue. If so,
share wildly. If they seem to have a good handle on it, let them work on their
solution until a challenge comes up.


### Tips

- Try not to work on the `main` branch in your fork - ideally you can keep this
  as just an updated copy of `main` from `FlurryGlo/slodon`.
- If your feature branch gets messed up, just update the `main` branch in your
  fork and create a fresh new clean "feature branch" where you can add your
  changes one by one in separate commits or all as a single commit.

### When does a review finish

A review finishes when all blocking comments are addressed and at least one
owning reviewer has approved the PR. Be sure to acknowledge any non-blocking
comments either by making the requested change, explaining why it's not being
addressed now, or filing an issue to handle it later.
