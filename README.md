## Motivation:

The reason for embarking on this project is pretty simple, actually. In the midst of all these "AI revolutions," I've got this strong urge to bring together a bunch of talented folks who share the same mindset. We can join forces and create something seriously awesome in the open source world.

You know, I think making some money out of it is a great idea. It's a real motivator for people, and it can help keep the projects running smoothly and reach their goals. (Take a look at the monetization plan for more info.)

## How to be part of the project:

You've got two choices here: you can either do your own thing and  [develop independently](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), or you can jump on board with the [core developer team](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/etc/core_developer.md). Just a heads up, the [monetization plan](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/etc/Monetization_plan.md)`only applies to those who are part of the core developer crew`. We appreciate any and all development efforts.

If you're curious about `becoming a core developer` and want more details, `check out this  page`: [becoming-core-developer](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/etc/core_developer.md).

## Why this project is not good for you:

This project is `not good` for you if:
-  you're hoping for a hassle-free startup with `quick and effortless gains`.

-  you're the type of person who needs `everything planned out right from the beginning`, well, we can't really promise that. We're not sure how far this project will go, to be honest. It's a bit of an unpredictable journey.

-  you possess a mindset that recognizes `the necessity of hiring talented individuals to achieve substantial goals`, particularly when competing against established million-dollar companies, then this project is likely aligned with your thinking.

- if you prefer `dedicating your time solely to the development of games and restaurant websites`, without a strong inclination toward groundbreaking ventures, this project may not be the right fit for

## Technical information:


Now we come to a crucial aspect of the project that `requires significant attention` and continuous improvement. As you may be aware, the field of AI is gradually transitioning towards open source, `enabling us to gain more insights` and delve into the underlying intricacies.

In this project, our primary focus will be on utilizing Python as the main programming language. We aim to develop an API based on the latest publications and research in the field, initially following established sequences. To ensure a `Pythonic approach`, we intend to incorporate type hints and adhere to best practices.

As the project progresses, it is highly likely that we will require more advanced mathematical skills to explore new concepts and ideas.

The technology stack for this project includes:

---
[Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.11-3.12)

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (for dependency management)


TBD (`front-end framework, to be determined`)
These components will serve as the foundation for our development process.
