## What is slodon?

*If I had to sum *Slodon* up then essentially Slodon will automate and do stuff for you based on what you ask, e.g you can simply ask it to perform actions like opening your file manager and creating a new 'work' file on your C drive, and it will take care of the job for you*. 

***Slodon*** functions as a *wrapper* for its sub-parts. We refer to the eco-system as Slodon with respect to its components. ”slodon”
means the eco-system whose main goal is to establish an [AI Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent). The agent aims to control [user space programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space) and interactions
using extensive language models and automated processes. The project’s primary stack is [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), capable of
empowering the [Python libraries](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon). At the moment *we believe that the best way to try Slodon out is by a typescript-based software*,
this app would use the **API/model**. We potentially could develop a [*scripting language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) that would be based on the [sub-components](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon) in
the background. This is still an ongoing investigation and the need for this feature must be discussed with more attention. Libraries
within Slodon are commonly denoted as its **sub-components or parts**, developed within the same GitHub repository. These
libraries are both *independent* and *strongly connected* with Slodon. Access each of the available sub-components:

## How to be part of the project:

You've got two choices here: you can either do your own thing and  [develop independently](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), or you can jump on board with the [core developer team](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/etc/core_developer.md).  We appreciate any and all development efforts.

If you're curious about `becoming a core developer` and want more details, `check out this  page`: [becoming-core-developer](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/main/etc/core_developer.md).
