# Short Conclusion
Basically, if I had to sum it up, Slodonix does all the heavy lifting when it comes to user interactions —clicking on programs, popping open tabs, you name it. Then, we've got this cool model called [SloSynth](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SloSynth), which we're training using all that action data. The model will be used to handle and automate all of these interactions based on the prompt that the user will provide. Please follow the readme for a more deep understanding.

# Introduction
Slodonix is an automated library for [emulated input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) purposes. The library **handles all the interactions**, and it’s something we can continuously enhance over time. It’s a highly tangible feature that users can *directly* experience and benefit from. It plays a vital role in the overall functionality. It’s not some "hidden magic" happening behind the scenes. When you give it a task, this library takes charge and carries out the necessary interactions. We are implementing templates for certain user actions such as: opening a window, closing a tab, running an application. Obviously we are thrived to make this process faster and extended it furthermore. One of the main benefits is that you can **keep an eye on the agent** and make adjustments if needed. It’s like watching the whole process *unfold in front of you*, instead of just receiving a file and having to start over from scratch if something goes wrong. It’s much more interactive and gives you immediate response.

<br/>

We are supporting the *essential* and most common operating systems such as support for *Linux*, *Windows*, and *MacOS* platforms. In Linux, we can work with display managers(servers), whereas in Windows, **For example**, the display is an integral part of the operating system itself. Additionally, the model may store additional user and platform information, and safety protocols are *crucial*. It’s essential to save the computer state to enable the ability to redo actions if necessary. Currently, the library operates as a Python sub-package and receives updates directly from the ***main*** branch.
