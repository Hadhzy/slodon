Well, as you can see in the [introduction](https://github.com/FlurryGlo/slodon/blob/hels15/etc/slodon.pdf), we need to deal with GUI interactions. 
To handle this, we utilize a sub-library which effectively manages all the necessary GUI operations.
Thus, we develop the `slodonix` library.

The active development is in the [slodon/slodonix](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/slodonix)
