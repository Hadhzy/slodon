# Short Conclusion
Basically, if I had to sum it up, SloSynth represents the AI model that needs to be trained on slodonix and [SloScrap](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SLoScrap), We utilise SloSynth for direct use in our typescript software application. One of the main ideas here is to reuse available techniques that are able to learn Python libraries and act as a discord bot in order to help users with their potential questions. For example the bot in reflex(Kyber-bot). Note that while we are not planning to develop any discord bots however the idea could be the same, and we think itâ€™s necessary to mention current solutions.
Also note that the idea and the development of SloSynth is in its early stages therefore this explanation will be significantly extendedin the future.
