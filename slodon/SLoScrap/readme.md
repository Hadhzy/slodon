# Short Conclusion
Basically, if I had to sum it up, SloScrap is essentially a custom web-scrapping library that  will be used to extract data from the web. SloScrap would make it possible to add more complicated structures which would work perfectly with Python.

# Introduction
SloScrap is a custom-web scrapping library meaning that it is a [web-scrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) library with custom features. *SloScrap would make it possible to add more complicated structures which would work perfectly with Python*. The existing options do not include this feature. The reason behind including custom features is because of [***Slosynth***](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SloSynth). [SloSynth](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SloSynth) represents the AI model that needs to be trained on [slodonix](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/slodonix) and [SloScrap](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/slodonix). Essentially [SloScrap](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SloScrap) will extract the data from the web that will be feed into [SloSynth](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/SloSynth) and then this data will be used for the model to make the necessary user actions using [slodonix](https://github.com/Hadhzy/slodon/tree/main/slodon/slodonix).
